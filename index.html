        <h1>About Chappati</h1>
        <p>
            Chappati is a traditional unleavened flatbread made with just 3 ingredients - whole wheat flour, ghee/oil
            and water.
            Optionally a little salt is added.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term chappati is derived from the Hindi work "Chapat" meaning "flat" which describes the traditional
            method of
            shaping chappati by flattening the dough in between the palms. Later rolling pin has taken over this method.

            <b>Thought chappati is made with same ingredients as Roti, both are not the same.</b>

        <h1>Chappati vs Roti</h1>
        <p>
            Roti also known as phulkha is essentially puffed and is cooked without any fats like ghee or oil. Sometimes it 
            is also cooked on direct flame to help it puff. Once it is off the heat ghee is smeared. Whereas a chappati may or 
            may not puff and is always cooked with fats. It is never cooked on open flame.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Roti is never layered but chappati is sometimes layered. In Maharashtra and some parts of Karnataka chappati is 
            layered just like plain paratha. In few other countries a flatbread inspired by chappati and lachha paratha is made 
            using a pleating technique.

        <h1>How to make Chappati (Stepwise recipe)</h1>
        <p>
            1. Add two cups flour to mixing bowl. Make a well in the center. Usually chappti is not salted but if you want you 
            may add quater teaspoon of salt and 1 to 1 and half teaspoons of oil. Pout three-quater cup of warm water. I use hot water 
            not boiling hot.<br> <br>
        </p>

            2. Begin to mix to form a soft dough. If using hot water use a spoon to mix first, later use fingers. If the dough is
            too dry, splash a bit of warm water and form the dough. Do not make it sticky. <br> <br>

        </p>
        <p>
            3. Knead for a minute or 2. Smoothen the dough with your palm. It should be soft not tight and dent easily when you poke 
            with your finger. Smear some water all over the dough. Cover and leave it for 30 minutes at least.
